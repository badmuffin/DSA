# DSA Problem Solutions

This repository contains all the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems I have solved across various platforms. 
The goal of this repository is to keep track of my progress in DSA, practice problem-solving techniques, and share solutions with others who may find them helpful.

I have organized the problems into various categories:

- Leetcode-Easy
- Leetcode-Medium
- Leetcode-Hard
- Tree
- Leetcode-30DaysJS
